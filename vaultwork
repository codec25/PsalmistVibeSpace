⌨️ New Commands you can use:
ls: See what folders/files are around you.

cd home then cd ninjas then ls: This will actually pull the live list of students from the database and show them as "folders".

provision NAME PASS: Still works exactly like before, but inside the bash terminal.

sudo freeze USER_1: For that extra "hacker" feel when you need to lock someone out.

clear: Wipes the terminal screen.

top: Shows the latest entries from the Audit Log.

Your system is now a fully functional "Web-Bash" terminal!
